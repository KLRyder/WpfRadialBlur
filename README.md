# WpfRadialBlur
Small WPF application to apply a radial blur to an image. Made as practice to derust my programming.

The Radial blur threaded is just an attempt to make the regular radial blur faster via nieeve multithreading, but the gains are very minor and lead to crashing more often than not.

TODO:
fix multithreading
get some actually usefull comments in there
generally just clean up the code
